# STAN Assignment

This Node.js application demonstrates handling race conditions using Redis and RabbitMQ for managing shared resources and inter-process communication.

## Overview

The project includes two main components:

1. **Incrementing Counter with Locks**: Demonstrates using Redis to increment a counter with a locking mechanism to prevent race conditions.
2. **Message Queue with RabbitMQ**: Uses RabbitMQ to manage a FIFO queue for coordinating updates between processes.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Redis
- RabbitMQ

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd STAN-Assignment
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Redis and RabbitMQ on your local environment or configure connection details in `index.js`.**

## Usage

1. **Initialize Counter**: Run the following command to initialize the counter in Redis:

   ```
   node index.js
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application to simulate race conditions and queue management:

   ```
   node index.js
   ```

## Structure

- `index.js`: Main entry point of the application.
- `README.md`: This file, providing project overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Future Improvements

- Implement comprehensive error handling for Redis and RabbitMQ interactions.
- Enhance testing coverage for edge cases and scalability.
